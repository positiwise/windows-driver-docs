# PnPUtil Command Syntax

PnPUtil (PnPUtil.exe) is included in every version of Windows starting with Windows Vista, in the %windir%\\system32 directory.

To run PnPUtil, open a command prompt window (Run as Administrator) and type a command using the following syntax and parameters.

```syntax
PNPUTIL [/add-driver <...> | /delete-driver <...> |
         /export-driver <...> | /enum-drivers |
         /enum-devices [<...>] | /enum-interfaces [<...>] |
         /disable-device <...> | /enable-device <...> |
         /restart-device <...> | /remove-device <...> |
         /scan-devices [<...>] | /enum-classes [<...>] |
         /?]
```

## Legacy Command Mapping

The following commands are still supported, but are legacy.  We recommend that you use the up-to-date syntax instead.

```syntax
  -a [-i]  <filename.inf> ==> /add-driver <filename.inf> [/install]

  -d [-f]  <oem#.inf>     ==> /delete-driver <oem#.inf> [/force]

  -e                      ==> /enum-drivers
```
