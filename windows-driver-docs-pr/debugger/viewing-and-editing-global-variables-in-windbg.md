# Viewing and Editing Global Variables in WinDbg (Classic)


## <span id="ddk_debugging_bios_code_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_DEBUGGING_BIOS_CODE_DBG"></span>


The debugger interprets the name of a global variable as a virtual address. Therefore, you can use all of the commands that are described in [Accessing Memory by Virtual Address](accessing-memory-by-virtual-address.md) to read or write global variables.

In addition, you can use the [**? (Evaluate Expression)**](---evaluate-expression-.md) command to display the address that is associated with any symbol.

In WinDbg, you can also use the Watch window to display and change global and local variables. The Watch window can display any list of variables that you want. These variables can include global variables and local variables from any function. At any time, the Watch window displays the values of those variables that match the current function's scope. You can also change the values of these variables through the Watch window.

To open the Watch window, choose **Watch** from the **View** menu. You can also press ALT+2 or click the **Watch** button on the toolbar: ![screen shot of the watch button.](images/tbwatch.png). ALT+SHIFT+2 closes the Watch window.

The following screen shot shows an example of a Watch window.

The Watch window can contain four columns. The **Name** and **Value** columns are always displayed, and the **Type** and **Location** columns are optional. To display the **Type** and **Location** columns, click the **Typecast** and **Locations** buttons, respectively, on the toolbar.
