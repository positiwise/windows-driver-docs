# !usb3kd.xhci\_dumpall


The [**!usb3kd.xhci\_dumpall**](-usb3kd-device-info.md) command displays information about all USB 3.0 host controllers on the computer. The display is based on the data structures maintained by the USB 3.0 host controller driver (UsbXhci.sys).

```dbgcmd
!usb3kd.xhci_dumpall [1]
```

The following screen shot show the output of the **!xhci\_dumpall**l command.

The output shows that there is one USB 3.0 host controller.

The output uses [Using Debugger Markup Language (DML)](debugger-markup-language-commands.md) to provide links. The links execute commands that give detailed information about the state of the host controller as it is maintained by the USB 3.0 host controller driver. For example, you could get detailed information about the host controller capabilities by clicking the [**!xhci\_capability**](-usb3kd-xhci-capability.md) link. As an alternative to clicking a link, you can enter a command. For example, to see information about the host controller's resource usage, you could enter the command **!xhci\_resourceusage 0xfffffa800536e2d0**.

**Note**  The DML feature is available in WinDbg, but not in Visual Studio or KD.
