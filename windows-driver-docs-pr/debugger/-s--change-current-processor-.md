# ~s (Change Current Processor)


The **~s** command sets which processor is debugged on a multiprocessor system.

In kernel mode, **~s** changes the current processor. Do not confuse this command with the [**~s (Set Current Thread)**](-s--set-current-thread-.md) command (which works only in user mode), the [**|s (Set Current Process)**](-s--set-current-process-.md) command, the [**||s (Set Current System)**](--s--set-current-system-.md) command, or the [**s (Search Memory)**](s--search-memory-.md) command.

```dbgcmd
~Processor s
```

## Remarks

You can specify processors only in kernel mode. In user mode, the tilde (~) refers to a thread.

You can immediately tell when you are working on a multiple processor system by the shape of the kernel debugging prompt. In the following example, 0: means that you are debugging the first processor in the computer.

```dbgcmd
0: kd>
```

Use the following command to switch between processors:

```dbgcmd
0: kd> ~1s
1: kd>
```

Now the second processor in the computer that is being debugged.
