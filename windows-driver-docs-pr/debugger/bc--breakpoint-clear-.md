<span id="_______Breakpoints______"></span><span id="_______breakpoints______"></span><span id="_______BREAKPOINTS______"></span> *Breakpoints*   
Specifies the ID numbers of the breakpoints to remove. You can specify any number of breakpoints. You must separate multiple IDs by spaces or commas. You can specify a range of breakpoint IDs by using a hyphen (-). You can use an asterisk (\*) to indicate all breakpoints. If you want to use a [numeric expression](numerical-expression-syntax.md) for an ID, enclose it in brackets (\[\]). If you want to use a [string with wildcard characters](string-wildcard-syntax.md) to match a breakpoint's symbolic name, enclose it in quotation marks ( " " ).
