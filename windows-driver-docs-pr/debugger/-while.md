# .while


The **.while** token behaves like the **while** keyword in C.

```dbgcmd
.while (Condition) { Commands } 
```

## <span id="ddk_token_while_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_TOKEN_WHILE_DBG"></span>Syntax Elements


<span id="_______Condition______"></span><span id="_______condition______"></span><span id="_______CONDITION______"></span> *Condition*   
Specifies a condition. If this evaluates to zero, it is treated as false; otherwise it is true. Enclosing *Condition* in parentheses is optional. *Condition* must be an expression, not a debugger command. It will be evaluated by the default expression evaluator (MASM or C++). For details, see [Numerical Expression Syntax](numerical-expression-syntax.md).

<span id="_______Commands______"></span><span id="_______commands______"></span><span id="_______COMMANDS______"></span> *Commands*   
Specifies one or more commands that will be executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true. This block of commands needs to be enclosed in braces, even if it consists of a single command. Multiple commands should be separated by semicolons, but the final command before the closing brace does not need to be followed by a semicolon.

## Remarks

The [**.break**](https://support.microsoft.com/help/833721/available-switch-options-for-the-windows-xp-and-the-windows-server-200) and [**.continue**](-continue.md) tokens can be used to exit or restart the *Commands* block.
