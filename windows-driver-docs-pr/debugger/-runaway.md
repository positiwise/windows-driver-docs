## Remarks

This extension is a quick way to find out which threads are spinning out of control or consuming too much CPU time.

The display identifies each thread by the debugger's internal thread numbering and by the thread ID in hexadecimal. The debugger IDs are also shown.

Here is an example:

```dbgcmd
0:001> !runaway 7

 Kernel Mode Time
 Thread       Time
 0:55c        0:00:00.0140
