For more information about and examples of how to use breakpoints, other breakpoint commands and methods of controlling breakpoints, and how to set breakpoints in user space from a kernel debugger, see [Using Breakpoints](using-breakpoints.md). For more information about conditional breakpoints, see [Setting a Conditional Breakpoint](setting-a-conditional-breakpoint.md).

## Remarks

You can use the **br** command to renumber any number of breakpoints at the same time. For each breakpoint, list the old ID and the new ID, in that order, as parameters to **br**.

If there is already a breakpoint with an ID equal to *NewID*, the command fails and an error message is displayed.
