## Remarks

Typically, branch tracing is enabled after the debugger initializes the processor control block (PRCB). This initialization occurs early in the boot process.

However, if you have to use the [**tb (Trace to Next Branch)**](tb--trace-to-next-branch-.md) command before this initialization, you can use the **.force\_tb** command to enable branch tracing earlier. Use this command carefully because it can corrupt your processor state.
