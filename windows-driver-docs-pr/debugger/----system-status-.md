## Remarks

The **||** command is useful only when you are debugging multiple targets. Many, but not all, multiple-target debugging sessions involve multiple systems. For more information about these sessions, see [Debugging Multiple Targets](debugging-multiple-targets.md).

Each system listing includes the server name and the protocol details. The system that the debugger is running on is identified as **&lt;Local&gt;**.

The following examples show you how to use this command. The following command displays all systems.
