# DispatchDeviceControl Routine of a Battery Miniclass Driver

The power manager sends device control IRPs (IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL) to the miniclass drivers through the composite battery driver. The [*DispatchDeviceControl*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine in the battery miniclass driver handles IRPs that contain battery IOCTLs.

In [*DispatchDeviceControl*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch), the miniclass driver can call the class driver's [**BatteryClassIoctl**](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nf-batclass-batteryclassioctl) routine to perform any system-defined device control tasks; **BatteryClassIoctl** handles device control IOCTLs for batteries.

The [*DispatchDeviceControl*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine should do the following:

1. If the miniclass driver defines any private IOCTLs, determine whether the current IOCTL is among them. If so, perform the requested operation, complete the IRP, specifying IO\_NO\_INCREMENT, and go to step 4.

2. If the IOCTL is not a private IOCTL defined by the miniclass driver, call **BatteryClassIoctl**, passing the IRP and the class handle returned by [**BatteryClassInitializeDevice**](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nf-batclass-batteryclassinitializedevice). For example:

    ```cpp
    Status = BatteryClassIoctl (NewBattNP->ClassHandle, Irp);
    ```

    The class driver's [**BatteryClassIoctl**](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nf-batclass-batteryclassioctl)routine determines whether the IOCTL is intended for the specified battery. If so, it calls the corresponding [BatteryMini*Xxx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_battery/) routine to satisfy the request and then completes the IRP, returning STATUS\_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it returns STATUS\_NOT\_SUPPORTED.

3. If [**BatteryClassIoctl**](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nf-batclass-batteryclassioctl) returns STATUS\_NOT\_SUPPORTED, indicating that this is not a battery IRP, pass the IRP to the next-lower driver.

4. Pass the returned status as its own function return value.
