# Creating a Driver Verification Log

Certain programs of the [Windows Hardware Certification Program](/windows-hardware/design/compatibility/) require a Driver Verification Log (DVL) for all driver submissions. The DVL contains a summary of the results from the Code Analysis (CA), Static Driver Verifier (SDV), and [CodeQL](../devtest/static-tools-and-codeql.md) log files. The DVL does not contain any source information. You must run the Code Analysis tool and Static Driver Verifier prior to creating a DVL for your driver.

**To create a driver verification log**

1.  Before running the Code Analysis tools, be sure that you can build and link your driver using the latest Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
2.  For the Driver Solution, make sure that you have selected a Release configuration as the Solution Configuration and x64 as the Solution Platform.
3.  Run [Static Driver Verifier](../devtest/static-driver-verifier.md). For information about creating the log file, see [Creating a log file for Static Driver Verifier](creating-a-log-file-for-static-driver-verifier.md) and [Using Static Driver Verifier to find defects in drivers](../devtest/using-static-driver-verifier-to-find-defects-in-drivers.md).
4.  Run the Code Analysis tool for drivers. Address and fix any defects that are found. See [Creating a log file for the code analysis tool](creating-a-log-file-for-the-code-analysis-tool.md) and [How to run Code Analysis for Drivers](../devtest/how-to-run-code-analysis-for-drivers.md). For more information about code analysis, see [Analyzing C/C++ Code Quality by Using Code Analysis](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/dd264897(v=vs.120)).
5.  Run CodeQL.  Address and fix defects that are found.  Certification will fail if defects that are deemed "Must-Fix" are not corrected.  For more information about CodeQL and the Static Tools Logo Test, see [CodeQL and the Static Tools Logo Test](../devtest/static-tools-and-codeql.md).
5.  Create the Driver Verification Log. From the **Driver** menu, select **Create Driver Verification Log...**.
6.  Verify that the Code Analysis Log, Static Driver Verifier Log, and CodeQL Log files are detected. Select **Create**.

The driver verification log has the file name extension .DVL.XML. The log is created in the project folder, for example, \\*myDriverProject*\\*myDriverName*.DVL.XML.

**Note**  SDV performs a clean rebuild of the driver, which removes the Code Analysis log.  As such, please be sure to run SDV before running CA.

**Note**  When you are ready to test your driver using the [Windows Hardware Lab Kit](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/), you need to copy the driver verification log to the %systemdrive%\\DVL directory on the test computer. Be sure to delete the contents of the directory on the test computer before you copy the new driver verification log.

For the most up-to-date information about the Code Analysis tool, Static Driver Verifier, and the Driver Verification Log, refer to the WDK Release Notes. The Release Notes are available on the [Windows Driver Kit (WDK) download page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=254897).

**Important**   Timeouts, spaceouts, and other non-successful results in the DVL file are acceptable for certification submission. This will not cause the Static Tools test in HLK to fail. 
 
You can also create the driver verification log from a Visual Studio Command Prompt window, either by the Visual Studio Native Tools Command Prompt installed with Visual Studio or via the Enterprise Windows Driver Kit (EWDK):

```cpp
msbuild.exe <vcxprojectfile> /target:dvl /p:Configuration="Release" /P:Platform=x64
```

## Creating a Driver Verification Log Outside of msbuild or Visual Studio

Microsoft ships as part of the [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](../download-the-wdk.md) and [Enterprise WDK (eWDK)](../download-the-wdk.md#enterprise-wdk-ewdk) a component called *dvl.exe* which can be used to generate Driver Verification Logs (DVLs) via command-line.  Starting in WDK/eWDK preview versions 21342 and above, it is possible to generate a DVL from the command line outside of the context of msbuild or Visual Studio. Follow the steps below to create the DVL via command-line:

1. Place the results that must be consumed to create the DVL in a single directory, along with any vcxproj file.  Typically for drivers intended to be certified for Windows Client, this is the [CodeQL SARIF file](../devtest/static-tools-and-codeql.md#3-perform-analysis-and-view-results).  For Windows Server certification, this may also include the Code Analysis and Static Driver Verifier (SDV) results files.  Check the [WHCP requirements](/windows-hardware/design/compatibility/whcp-specifications-policies) documents for specific details on which tools are required to be run for device driver certification.
2. CodeQL SARIF files and Code Analysis XML files should be placed in the top level of the directory.  The SDV DVL.xml file should be placed in a “sdv” subfolder.
3. From the command line, navigate to the top-level directory which contains the CodeQL SARIF file.
4. Locate dvl.exe from the WDK or a mounted eWDK.
5. Call dvl.exe by passing the /manualCreate flag, a driver name, and a desired architecture. For example:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Tools\dvl\dvl.exe" /manualCreate driverName driverArchitecture
```

One of the following strings should be used for your driverArchitecture string:

- X86
- X64
- Arm
- Arm64

**Do not include ".sys" as part of your driverName string**


6. Inspect the generated DVL to ensure that it was generated correctly

This usage is primarily intended for generating DVLs with CodeQL results, but can also be used for SDV and CA results.
