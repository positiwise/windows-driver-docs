# V4 Driver Connectivity Architecture

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

The key goal of connectivity components in the v4 print driver model is to provide rich support for bidirectional communications via the Bidirectional Schema, sometimes referred to simply as Bidi.

The v4 print driver model supports a simplified connectivity stack compared to the v3 print driver model.

## Port monitors and language monitors

Third-party port monitors and language monitors are not supported in the v4 driver model or with print class drivers. The v4 print driver model continues to employ the WSDMon Bidi Extension file format, as well as the SNMP Bidi Extension file format. New in v4 is the ability to support Bidi over USB using the USBMon Bidi Extension XML and JavaScript files.

## Bidirectional schema

The following table shows the files and the information that you must provide, depending on the features that you want to support and the type of communication protocol that you select for your print device.
